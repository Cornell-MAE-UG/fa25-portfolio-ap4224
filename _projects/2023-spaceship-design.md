On the left is an image of a jet engine (taken from Wikimedia Commons), which is a propulsion device that creates thrust by accelerating air to a high exhaust velocity. They are an excellent example to use for thermodynamic analysis because they use compressors, turbines, combustion, and nozzles to create a working steady-flow system. This report analyzes jet engines by modeling it using a control-volume system of thermodynamics.

These are the major components of the jet engine:
1. Inlet: increases pressure and slows incoming air
2. Compressor: increases air pressure and temperature
3. Combustion Chamber: burns fuel at constant pressure
4. Turbine: drives the compressor by extracting work
5. Nozzle: produces thrust by accelerating exhaust gasses

Air enters the engine through the inlet, where it is slowed down and slightly compressed. Then, the compressor increases the pressure and temperature of the air by doing shaft work on it. Then this air enters the combustion chamber where fuel is burned which significantly increases the temperature. The hot gases expand through the turbnine, which extracts work to drive the compressor. Finally, the remaining exhaust expands through the nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy. Thrust is produced by the jet engine to propel the jet forward.

Here are some equations and analysis of a standard jet engine:
