I designed a wheel for the Mars Rover Project Team using Autodesk Fusion 360. Some things that I focused on were tread design, dimensions, lightening hole shapes, etc.

The main focus was on treads. The treads had to be designed so that the sand could exit easily when the rover traversed across the Mars-simulated terrain. I added a straight edge to the ends of the tread to maintain a constant tread width and create consistent contact with the ground. In the middle, I added a curve to allow the sand to collect and flow out outwards through the help of gravity. In order to avoid stress concentrations, I added fillets to all sharp edges.

As for the dimensions, I increased the diameter to 10.5 in and the width to 4 in so that the rover doesn't get stuck in holes. Increased diameter makes it easier to climb out of holes. A wheel escapes a hole by rotating up the exit slope, and with a larger radius, there is lesser curvature that the wheel has at the contact point of the hole. Larger radius also reduces how deep the wheel can fall inside the hole with the same width. As for increasing the width to 4 in, a wheel cannot fall into a hole that has a smaller width than the wheel. With a 4 in width, the hole must be wider than 4 in and deeper than 0.396 in [vertical drop = R-sqrt(R^2-(W/2)^2)] before the wheel sinks in and tries to escape.

For the lightening holes, I added 20 and shaped it so that it would take up more space while maintaining a safe distance between the next lightening hole. The goal of the lightening holes was to remove mass from the overall wheel. Lower mass leads to lower motor torque required and lower rotational intertia, which means easier acceleration and ability to turn around. It's also easier to manufacture since it takes lesser time to print out and reduces the thermal gradients.
