On the left is an image of a jet engine (taken from Wikimedia Commons), which is a propulsion device that creates thrust by accelerating air to a high exhaust velocity. They are an excellent example to use for thermodynamic analysis because they use compressors, turbines, combustion, and nozzles to create a working steady-flow system. This report analyzes jet engines by modeling it using a control-volume system of thermodynamics.

Air enters the engine through the inlet, where it is slowed down and slightly compressed. Then, the compressor increases the pressure and temperature of the air by doing shaft work on it. Then this air enters the combustion chamber where fuel is burned which significantly increases the temperature. The hot gases expand through the turbine, which extracts work to drive the compressor. Finally, the remaining exhaust expands through the nozzle, converting thermal energy into kinetic energy. Thrust is produced by the jet engine to propel the jet forward.

Here are some equations and analysis of a standard jet engine:

One improvement we could make is increasing the compressor pressure ratio while keeping a reasonable turbine inlet temperature. This would create a higher exit velocity, which would lead to higher thrust. One tradeoff is that excessive pressure ratios increase compressor work and entropy generation.
